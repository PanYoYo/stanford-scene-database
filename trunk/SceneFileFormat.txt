
---- Scene File Format

The scene file format is meant to be very easy to parse ASCII.
For completeness we document it here; see Scene.cpp for a sample parser, and databaseSample\scenes\SceneA.txt for a sample scene.

The first three lines are:
StanfordSceneDatabase
version <major version>.<minor version>
modelCount <N>

Then N "newModel X Y" commands follow. X is the model index and Y is the model ID. This model ID is used to refer to
models in the fields and models folders. It is also used by Google 3D Warehouse, using the "mid" tag:
http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=27cbe370f005ea9ef0524a49202e8ac9

All lines after a "newModel" line refer to the most recent "newModel". The possible fields are:

"parentIndex X": X is the model index of this objects parent. -1 if this model is the root node.

"children <list of integers>": the model indices of all the children of this node.

"parentContactPosition X Y Z": the coordinates of the location on the parent model where this object is attached.

"parentContactNormal X Y Z": the surface normal of the location on the parent model where this object is attached.

"parentOffset X Y Z": an additional translation offset specified by the artist relative to parentContactPosition.
                      This is (0, 0, 0) for almost all objects; it is non-zero for floating or hovering objects.

"transform <list of 16 floats>": The matrix transform from the local coordinate frame specified in the model's
								 *.obj to the world coordinates of the scene.

parentContactPosition, parentContactNormal, and parentOffset are not needed to just render the scene; the "transform" field
already incorporates these terms.
